# Instructions For Installation and Running

In the Putty, we first need to write the command 


git config --global user.name "Your Name"

git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"


to identify you as the author of commits. Then we use the command 


cd /var/www/html


because this is the directory to make our webpage available in the browser and use the git clone command to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. To use the git clone command, type


sudo git clone https://github.com/bryankb10/open-source.git

Now, we need to check the ip addr by typing

ip addr

and type the ip address in the browser. This will show the "open-source" folder. Press that folder and then press the menurestaurant.php to start the webpage. We also can use qr code by pressing the qrcode_generator.php to make it available in mobile phone. However, in order for thisbto work, the mobile device must connect to the same WiFi network with the computer running the webpage.
