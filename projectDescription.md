# Project Description

For this project, we created 7 main files, they are tablerestaurant.sql, pdoconnect.php, menurestaurant.php, summaryrestaurant.php, customer_details.php, finalizeorder.php, orderHistory.php, and finally qrcode_generator.php. We also have several images for the menu items, as well as a png file for the design of the web page.

We created tablerestaurant.sql to make a database that stores the category names, the name of the menu items, as well as the pictures and the price. We then send this file to MariaDB. To connect the database to our php fi
